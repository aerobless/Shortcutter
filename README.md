===========
Not everyone is born as a shortcut-wizard. But everyone can learn to be one. That's where Shortcutter comes in. It's a handy tool to keep track of your shortcuts and to train them daily. Shortcutter knows what application you're currently using and sends you ocassionally short notifications with shortcuts that you could use.
